## Boilerplate Express App

Made this for my convenience a while ago to reduce the configuration of a new express app whenever it is needed
---

Can clone the repository in some local system

```
https://github.com/gnaaruag/boilerplate-express-app.git
```

After cloning the only step required is to 
```
npm i
```
---

Needs customisation based on the project
Check package.json before running `"npm install"`
